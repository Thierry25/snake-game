# Snake Game
Basic replication of the popular snake game, using Python's Turtle graphics library.

This project is based on a course that I'm following on Udemy 100 Days of Code in Python with Angela Yu.

## What I learnt in this section

* Implementation OOP in Python (way easier than JavaðŸ˜…)
* Cool features of the Turtle graphics library in Python

### Features
* Food created randomly on the canvas 
* Snake moves using arrows (Up, Down, Left and Right)
* Snake gets extended each time food is consumed
* Detection of walls and own tail (Game Over)
